        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>I'm Olly Nevard, a Head of Software Engineering and Full-Stack Engineer based in Colchester, UK.</p>

        <p>I've spent the last 15+ years bridging the gap between complex infrastructure and intuitive product design. Currently, I lead engineering teams to deliver critical user-facing tools, while ensuring the underlying infrastructure is scalable and secure.</p>

        <p>My background is a mix of product and platform. I've worked as a Lead UI Developer, built infrastructure as a Senior SRE, and now architect solutions that blend both worlds. I love writing well-tested, easy-to-understand services and automating manual processes to help teams move faster.</p>

        <p>This site is my digital playground — a place to document what I'm learning, experiment with new tech, and share the code behind it.</p>

        <h3>My Philosophy</h3>

        <p>I approach engineering with two core principles:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Pragmatism over Perfection: I focus on robust, efficient solutions that deliver value, rather than over-engineering for hypothetical problems.</li>
            <li>Automate Everything: If I need to do something twice, I script it. I'm passionate about CI/CD and removing bottlenecks to keep delivery smooth.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Outside of work</h2>

        <p>When I'm not at my desk, I'm usually on the move.</p>

        <p>I'm a dad to two very active kids, so my weekends are mostly spent on the sidelines of football pitches and gymnastics mats.</p>

        <p>My wife is a Personal Trainer, so keeping fit is a big part of our household routine — whether that's working out or walking the dog.</p>
